## Introduction
# Acute Myeloid Leukemia

Acute Myeloid Leukemia is characterized by an increase in the number of myeloid cells in the marrow and the premature terminal of the maturation of these myeloid cells. This results primarily in hematopoietic insufficiency.

# Azacitidine

Azacitidine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) which has been used to treat AML patients. However, it is unclear which genes are regulated or hypomethyalted by Azacitidine. Understanding which genes are regulated by Azacitidine could provide us with a better understanding of ...

# Study Design

In this study, OCI-AML3 cells were treated with 5-azacytidine, with a paired control. The experiment was done in triplicates and then total RNA was sequenced.  

## Data QC
# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Through PCA, we can check if the treatment condition is the main variable responsible for variation in the data and to check if our replicates within each condition is similar.
