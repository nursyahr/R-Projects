# R Programming

Classic Tic-Tac-Toe game against computer via command-line interface.

# Purpose

- Part of the [R Programming](https://github.com/nursyahr/training-requirements/tree/main/R%20Programming) training requirements to undertake projects by the [Bioinformatics-Research-Network](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/training-requirements).

# Task
Write an R script that will allow you to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe against your computer using the command line. 

Create a script that lets you play a full game of tic-tac-toe, given that:
1. The script has to be executable using `Rscript <your_script.R>` (e.g., `Rscript tic-tac-toe.R`).
2. All the rules of tic-tac-toe are included. `X` always goes first, then `O`. The first to get three-in-a-row wins. A stalemate when no moves remain is a tie.
3. The script should ask the player to choose moves using a prompt (see example). 
4. There should be no errors. No matter what the user inputs, they shouldn't see any errors. 

All code should be commited using `git` and pushed to your fork of the training repo on GitHub. 

# How to play it

1. Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).
2. Download **`TicTacToe.R`**.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the file on shell.
4. Run `rscript TicTacToe.R`.
5. Have fun!
