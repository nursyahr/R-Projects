# Basic Data Science Web Development

**This challenge can be completed using `R-Shiny` OR `plotly-dash`**

Suggested pre-requisites (if using `python`): [Python Programming](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/training-requirements/tree/main/Python%20Programming) and [Python for Data Science](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/training-requirements/tree/main/Python%20for%20Data%20Science)

Suggested pre-requisites (if using `R`): [R Programming](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/training-requirements/tree/main/R%20Programming) and [R for Data Science](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/training-requirements/tree/main/R%20for%20Data%20Science)

Create and deploy a `dash` (or `shiny`) application for exploring the gapminder dataset:

1. Get the Gapminder dataset (provided in this repo)
2. Create the basic `dash` (or `shiny`) application to display the dataset
3. Add callbacks (or server code if using `shiny`) that allow the user to:
- Switch from linear to log scale on the axes
- Change the data type displayed in the plot
- Change the year being shown
4. Improve the layout and UI so that it is easy and relatively intuitive to use
5. Deploy your app (using a free account) to `Heroku` and send Henry the link.
